# CT - INFOB318

CT-Application downloads Belgian certificates from the logs of the Certificate Transparency project and visits the corresponding websites to find data about the company to which the certificate belongs, such as the VAT number.  The application also stores data about the downloaded certificates: subject, issuer, validity period and signature algorithm.

This data can be used to identify malicious behavior online.  However, CT-Application does not provide detection of malicious behavior.

As its name suggests, CT-Application is based on Google's Certificate Transparency project.  This project has a much broader objective.  For more information about the Certificate Transparency project, visit their website https://www.certificate-transparency.org.

Documentation is available (in French only) in the [doc folder](doc).
